Simpel Accounting 2016

Simpel (the more phonetically correct way to spell the word "simple") accounting is
a system of accounting designed to provide clarity and transparency for anyone
trying to understand where money is being obtained and spent by a corporation,
city, person, or any other government or legal entity.

By having the income statement be on a cash basis (and without including any
non-cash revenue and expense items, e.g. depreciation or amortization) and
having accrual expense and revenue items separately stated, abusive accounting
practices have little persuasion on unknowledgeable readers of such financial
statements.

The Simpel Accounting system as well as the web code is free to use with
the following exceptions...
